    <td>We carried on from last lesson and we were using the electrical components. I was typing for some of the time and so was my partners. We moved onto another stage where we had to use the components to try to light up the six L.E.D. using wires and resistors. We did get the coding wrong so we had to do it again but it was just copying the code from the manual so we did it fairly quickly. We were just getting up to the stage where we use light dependent resistors and other new components. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We got the coding wrong the first time so that did shorten the time we had left because we read the coding wrong and if you get one bit wrong it will affect the whole code and it will no longer work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will look at the manual more carefully and follow the code more carefully. We will work through the book and complete the rest of the stages.</td>
