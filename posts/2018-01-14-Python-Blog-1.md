    <td>We carried on from last lesson when we were introduced to python, where we have to go onto the website code academy and do python exercises on it to do with code. On the first time I got my first badge called max streak count of 1. Now I have got three more badges: python syntax, tip calculator and strings and console output. I am on 14% and I was last on 9%. The exercises involve them giving examples and you having to do similar examples. I managed to complete most of them without being stuck.  </td>
