    <td>We carried on from last lesson where we were using the components with the Fuze box. Last lesson we made the L.E.D. light up and we used some wires and a variable resistor. THis lesson we used 5 variable resistors, 4 L.E.D.s and wires. Only one of the L.E.D.s lit up and all of them were supposed to. Another person helped us try and make it light up but we tried and it still didn't light up. By the end still one lit up but we still managed to get further than last lesson so that was an improvement.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We worked slowly as we didnâ€™t know what was causing only one to light up so we spent too much time on that section whereas we should have just moved onto the next section and tried the one we were stuck on at the end of the lesson.</td>
