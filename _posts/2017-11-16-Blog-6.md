    <td>I started off by helping another person in my group with his blog. His website didn't work and the same problem happened to me so I knew exactly what to do. After I helped fix his blog we moved onto the Fuze box. We started with a box of components and we had to plug in two wires, a resistor and an L.E.D. which was supposed to light up. We struggled with lighting it up and we tried three times and it still didn’t light up. In the end we asked a friend and he managed to help us and our L.E.D. managed to light up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We didn’t ask for help at first but we managed to fix it in the end but if we asked earlier then we could have moved onto other stages.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will ask for help earlier if we need it, therefore we would get more done in the lesson and understand where and how we went wrong, instead of not knowing it at all.</td>
